# Create 3 classes: Base, Square, and Triangle.
# All 3 classes have the solve_area function.
# Use inheritance and polymorphism to solve the square and triangle's area. 

class Base:
    # ? assume flat sirfaces ?
    def solve_area(self, num1, num2):
        return 

class Square:
    def solve_area(self, s1, s2):
        return s1 * s2

class Triangle:
    def solve_area(self, b, h):
        return b * h / 2
